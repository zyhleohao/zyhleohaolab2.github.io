## Q1
The topic I choose is about the sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources. The two parameters that I used for search are "Renewable Energy" and "Clean Energy".

## Q2
The purpose of the comparison is to investigate any potential subtle differences in meaning between the terms "clean energy" and "renewable energy," as they are often employed in relation to sustainable energy sources. The goal is to determine whether there are any obvious discrepancies in the conversation surrounding these terms and how the terminology choice affects the information retrieved.

## Q3
When one looks at the word clouds that are produced for "Renewable Energy" and "Clean Energy," some interesting differences surface. Words like solar, wind, fossil, and fuel are prominently displayed in the word cloud for "renewable energy". In comparison, the word cloud for "Clean Energy" has a wider range of concepts, such as carbon, climate, and hydrogen, and goes beyond renewable sources.

## Q4
The observed discrepancies in the word clouds could be explained by the definition of "Clean Energy," which is more expansive and covers a wider range of behaviors and technologies than only renewable energy sources. These patterns represent the changing discourse and vocabulary in the field of renewable energy.

## Q5
I think the research can be improve by refine the search parameters. For example, adding sentiment analysis could also shed light on the emotional tenor of conversations around clean and renewable energy. A more sophisticated understanding might result from further investigating vocabulary changes, for as by adding keywords like "Green Energy" or "Sustainable Energy."

## Q6
The word clouds for "Renewable Energy" and "Clean Energy" showed unexpected variances, highlighting the crucial role terminology plays in forming the discourse surrounding sustainable energy. The non-renewable yet low-emission technologies that were included under "Clean Energy" were noteworthy; this suggests that this category takes a more comprehensive approach than was first thought. This emphasizes how carefully selecting search phrases and creating word clouds are necessary steps toward developing a thorough grasp of the intricate subject of sustainable energy.
